# basil-syntax README

Adds syntax highlighting support for the [Basil programming language](https://github.com/basilTeam/basil).

## Features

Currently just a TextMate grammar for Basil tokens. Given that Basil is still highly WIP, this is subject to frequent change.

By default, the file extensions `.bl` and `.basil` are associated with this extension.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Added existence.
